		"description": "<h5>Vegetable sauce</h5> Add olive oil and heat. Add chopped onion and cook until golden, then add garlic and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the vegetables in the mix (carrot and courgettes/aubergines here, but honestly use anything in the fridge...) and cook until the carrots are tender. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 mins, then add spinach and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, salt and pepper and cook for 5 mins. Then set aside. <h5>Bechamel sauce</h5> In a saucepan over low heat, melt the vegan butter. Then slowly add flour and keep mixing until a smooth paste forms. Then gradually add the warm vegan milk and keep whisking/mixing until the sauce is smooth and thick. Remove from heat and add vegan cheese. <h5>Assembly</h5> Spread a thin layer of the vegetable mixture to the bottom of the baking dish, layer lasagna sheets on top, spread 1/3 of the vegetable mixture, then spread 1/3 of the Bechamel sauce and sprinkle vegan cheese on top. Repeat this layering twice more for a total of 3 layers, finishing with a layer of Bechamel sauce and vegan cheese on top. Spray the bottom of some kitchen foil with cooking spray and cover the top of the pan/tray loosely. <h5>Cooking</h5> Bake at 180C, covered for 40 minutes and then uncovered for another 15-20. Let cool for 15-20 minutes before serving. <br /> <a href=\"https://www.thecookingfoodie.com/recipe/How-to-Make-Vegetable-Lasagna\">source</a>",
