## Log:

### 1967
#### Paul McCartney - The Family Way
Released on January 6th 1967

The way in which each Beatle decided to explore their new found freedom after performing their last concert on 29th August 1966 was varied. Paul's first instinct was to go on a road safari across Africa with Mal Evans, and on returning announced his commitment to cultural self-improvement. As part of this, before going to holiday to France he wrote 15 seconds of music for the main theme of the film he'd been asked to compose for by the directors of an upcoming film called "The Family Way", and after his road safari wrote "Love In The Open Air" on guitar. Somehow from these, George Martin not only composed an entire 26 minute soundtrack but a shockingly cohesive and appealing one - perhaps even more shocking is that despite his little contribution, Paul's name is plastered large on the front cover. The soundtrack sounds like pretty much any other of the period - upbeat orchestral pieces that if you've heard the B-side of Yellow Submarine you'll be more than familiar with. To many, this doesn't count as a Paul solo album and it's easy to see why, but despite that it is a charming album that doesn't overstay its welcome and is composed with care by George Martin.

Verdict: B-
