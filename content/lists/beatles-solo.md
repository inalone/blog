## Log:

### 1967
#### Paul McCartney - The Family Way
Released on January 6th 1967

The way in which each Beatle decided to explore their new found freedom after performing their last concert on 29th August 1966 was varied. Paul's first instinct was to go on a road safari across Africa with Mal Evans, and on returning announced his commitment to cultural self-improvement. As part of this, before going to holiday to France he wrote 15 seconds of music for the main theme of the film he'd been asked to compose for by the directors of an upcoming film called "The Family Way", and after his road safari wrote "Love In The Open Air" on guitar. Somehow from these, George Martin not only composed an entire 26 minute soundtrack but a shockingly cohesive and appealing one - perhaps even more shocking is that despite his little contribution, Paul's name is plastered large on the front cover. The soundtrack sounds like pretty much any other of the period - upbeat orchestral pieces that if you've heard the B-side of Yellow Submarine you'll be more than familiar with. To many, this doesn't count as a Paul solo album and it's easy to see why, but despite that it is a charming album that doesn't overstay its welcome and is composed with care by George Martin.

Verdict: B-

### 1968
#### George Harrison - Wonderwall Music
Released on 1 November 1968

Not one to be outdone, George too made a film soundtrack album. As a one-up on Paul however, George actually wrote the entirety of Wonderwall Music as well as performing on it. There is an immense amount of care put into this album, but simultaneously you can tell the fun that George had collaborating with Indian artists, fellow Beatles, Eric Clapton, The Remo Four and others. The contrast of western influences with the Indian influences on here aren't two opposing sides, but go further than George's attempts at fusing the two in songs like Within You Without You he had done the previous year, and as a result feel more refined - rather than simply putting English lyrics over Indian instrumentation, there is a conscious effort to blend the two compositionally and instrumentally and it works really well. It's difficult to make any jokes or rib on this album - George had a huge amount of fun making an album in which he constantly liased with the director to see if pieces fit scenes, and some of the tracks on here are stunning. Despite all that, as a whole I don't come out feeling particularly wowed, but rather just impressed and with a ton of respect towards George - take what he does on here and compare it to some of the stuff he was writing only a few years before and it's difficult to disagree with those who argue that George was the Beatle who most improved over the lifetime of the band.

Verdict: B
